🐱🔥 Squishy Cat

A cute, chaotic survival game built in Godot.

Squishy Cat is a fast-paced, arcade-style dodging game where you control an adorably stretchy cat trying to survive an endless rain of fiery orbs. The longer you avoid danger, the higher your score—and the funnier the cat physics get.

🎮 Core Gameplay

Control a soft, stretchy cat that deforms and elongates based on movement.

Dodge falling fire orbs that drop at increasing speed and intensity.

Survive as long as possible to set a new personal or global high score.

Simple controls, expressive squash-and-stretch animations, and endless replayability.

🛠️ Tools Leveraged

Godot Engine 4.5 – Core platform used to build, script, and run the entire game.
